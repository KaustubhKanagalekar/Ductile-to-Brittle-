Parameters for the problem
Temp = [0, -25, -50, -75,-100,-113, -125, -150, -175, -200]
Impact_energy = [105,104,103, 97,63,40,34,28,25,24]
This code will make a plot of Temperature vs. Impact Energy
plot(Temp, Impact_energy)
xlabel("Temp (Celsius)")
ylabel("Impact Energy (J)")
title("Graph of Temperature vs. Impact Energy")
This code will establish a ductile-to-brittle  transition  temperature  as  the  temperature  corresponding to the average of the maximum and minimum impact energies. - Answer is approximately -99 Celsius
%This code finds the minimum impact energy (J) 
minimum_IE = min(Impact_energy)
%This code finds the maximum impact energy (J) 
maximum_IE= max(Impact_energy)
%This code will average out the impact energies (J) 
average_IE = (minimum_IE+maximum_IE)/2

%Using the graph, the temperature corresponding to
% the average impact energy is 
% approximately -99 Celsius
This code will establish a ductile-to-brittle transition temperature as the temperature at which the impact energy is 50 J. Answer is approximately -107.5 Celsius
%Using the graph, the temperature corresponding to
% the 50 J is 
% approximately -107.5 Celsius
